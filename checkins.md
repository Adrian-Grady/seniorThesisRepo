## Week 1 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)

### This week I worked on:

Understanding the library and implementing base functionality(i.e. piece array/getter/mover, basic heuristic)

### This week I learned:

Primarily, just how the library actually functions and what it covers and doesn't cover.

### My successes this week were:
I got my core objectives done.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

The library is a little bit more limited than I'd initially thought, which'll mean more work for me.

[Your answer here]
The basics of the human UI

[Your answer here]

## Week 3 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)
### This week I worked on:
Getting an extremely simplistic version of the scoring heuristic functional

### This week I learned:
Some more about the library, but mostly just thinking about how to actually score positions in chess.

### My successes this week were:
I did get a very, very, *very* simplistic version of the AI working. It's nothing grand, but it's at least enough to successfully take enemy pieces and move with something vaguely resembling intention.
