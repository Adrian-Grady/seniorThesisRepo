## Week 1 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)

### This week I worked on:

Understanding the library and implementing base functionality(i.e. piece array/getter/mover, basic heuristic)

### This week I learned:

Primarily, just how the library actually functions and what it covers and doesn't cover.

### My successes this week were:
I got my core objectives done.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

The library is a little bit more limited than I'd initially thought, which'll mean more work for me.

## Week 2 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)
### This week I worked on:

[Your answer here]
The basics of the human UI

[Your answer here]
I have a base functionality working- it's still a little clinky, and it's generally not ideal, but it does fundamentally work. I need to optimize it better.

[Your answer here]
There's a lot of edge cases in chess- castling, en passant, promotion, etc- that I need to cover in better detail, both from a programming perspective and from a user interface perspective.

## Week 3 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)
### This week I worked on:
Getting an extremely simplistic version of the scoring heuristic functional

### This week I learned:
Some more about the library, but mostly just thinking about how to actually score positions in chess.

### My successes this week were:
I did get a very, very, *very* simplistic version of the AI working. It's nothing grand, but it's at least enough to successfully take enemy pieces and move with something vaguely resembling intention.

### The challenges I faced this week were:
Having a basic scoring heuristic is fine, but it doesn't search through any depth whatsoever- it's a first-order solution, but clearly insufficient.

## Week 4 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)
### This week I worked on:
Expanding the calculation- I had to set up an actual tree to do that.

### This week I learned
Not a ton, frankly- setting up the tree is something that I've done plenty of times before, it just takes a bit of time to actually get working.

### My successes this week were:

Minimal, frankly. I bounced back and forth between different implementations multiple times, and as a result didn't get much in the way of solid results.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Figuring out how to actually implement the tree, ideally without massive speed penalties. There are a lot of ways to do it, but speed is at a premium here, and so I need to take care with how I actually end up doing it.

## Week 5 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)
### This week I worked on:

Continuing tree implementation

### This week I learned:

Objects are love, objects are life. I was trying to be fancy by passing up an int, but just giving up and using a struct fixed all my problems, and still works plenty fast.

### My successes this week were:

It actually works. It's still frightfully slow, but it can, at least, look 3 moves into the future(5 would take far, far, *far* too long)

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Mostly just experimentation/playing around, frankly. Again, there wasn't anything grand or revolutionary, just... figuring out what I actually wanted to do.

---

## Week 6 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)
### This week I worked on:

Optimizing my searching via alpha-beta testing.

### This week I learned:

I learned what alpha-beta testing is. I can't say I fully understand it, but it's pretty clearly a more efficient way than what I was doing.

### My successes this week were:

Nothing direct, but at least I have a promising path forwards, and implementing the alpha-beta testing shouldn't be too hard.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Trying to figure out this new technique is never easy, especially when it's so removed from what I'm used to- I just don't have much experience with these sorts of optimizations.

---

## Week 7 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)
### This week I worked on:

Continuing alpha-beta testing.

### This week I learned:

Pre-organization matters a lot, apparently. I have the alpha-beta testing working, but it's nowhere near as efficient as I'd like it to be- only about 15-20% better, and I need to to be more like 80-90% better.

### My successes this week were:

I at least got it working, and it *does* have some improvements- the first move was searching through 8000 nodes, now it's only searching through ~6300.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

It's clearly just... not good enough. There's clearly a lot of room for improvement, and I'll need it if I want to actually get this going.
