# Software Requirements Specification for the Text-Based Chess Bot

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements of the **Text-Based Chess Bot** system.  
The system is designed to allow users to play chess entirely through text commands, enabling gameplay via terminal interfaces, chat applications, or other text-based environments.

This specification serves as a contract between developers, testers, and stakeholders to ensure that the chess bot meets all gameplay, usability, and performance expectations while adhering to standard chess rules as defined by the **Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE)**.

**Key Goals:**

- To provide users with an accessible and intuitive way to play chess via text commands.  
- To ensure the bot adheres to official chess rules and enforces valid move logic.  
- To provide a basic AI opponent for single-player gameplay.  
- To support command-line or text-chat interfaces.  

---

### Scope

The **Text-Based Chess Bot** will enable users to play chess either against another player or an AI opponent through simple text input and output.

**The system will handle:**

- **Game Initialization:** Starting a new game, choosing AI difficulty, and selecting color (white or black).  
- **Move Input and Validation:** Accepting standard algebraic notation (e.g., `qf3 - f4`) or simplified text commands.  
- **Game Logic Enforcement:** Ensuring all moves follow official chess rules, including check, checkmate, stalemate, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.  
- **AI Opponent:** Providing configurable difficulty levels using heuristic-based decision-making.  
- **Game Display:** Showing an ASCII/text-based board and move history.  
- **Game Management:** Supporting saving, loading, and resigning from games.

### Overview

The **Text-Based Chess Bot** is a terminal- or chat-based program designed to allow users to play chess in a fully text-driven environment. It provides a responsive and interactive experience through command-line input, responding with formatted ASCII board representations and status updates after each move.

**System Features:**

- **Game Start and Setup:** Users can create a new game, select AI difficulty, and choose their color.  
- **Text-Based Interface:** All interaction occurs via plain text commands and responses.  
- **Move Validation and Rules Enforcement:** The system enforces all standard chess rules automatically.  
- **AI Opponent:** The system includes an AI with multiple difficulty levels.  
- **Game Saving and Loading:** Players can save ongoing games to a file and resume later.  
- **Move History and Undo:** Players can view or revert moves during a match (optional feature).  
- **Endgame Detection:** The system detects and reports check, checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions.  

The system is designed for extensibility and portability, allowing future integration into chatbots or web APIs.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1.1: Start a New Game

**Actors:** Player (human or AI)  
**Overview:** Player initializes a new chess game session.  

**Typical Course of Events:**

1. System prompts: “Would you like to start a new game?”  
2. Player inputs “yes” or “new game.”  
3. System asks: “Select AI difficulty”  
4. Player selects a number between 1 and 5, corresponding with increasing difficulty.  
5. System initializes a new chess board and displays it.  

**Alternative Courses:**

- Step 2: Player inputs invalid command → system displays help message.  

---

### Use Case 1.2: Make a Move

**Actors:** Player  
**Overview:** Player makes a move using standard algebraic notation.  

**Typical Course of Events:**

1. System displays the current board.  
2. Player types a move (e.g., `e2e4`).  
3. System validates the move.  
4. If valid, system updates the board and displays the result.  
5. If AI is active, AI responds with its move.  

**Alternative Courses:**

- Step 3: Move invalid → system displays “Invalid move. Try again.”  
- Step 5: If checkmate or stalemate detected → go to Use Case 1.5 (Game Over).  

---

### Use Case 1.3: Save and Load Game

**Actors:** Player  
**Overview:** Player saves a current game or loads a previously saved game.  

**Typical Course of Events:**

1. Player types `save game`.  
2. System prompts for filename and saves the current state in PGN or FEN format.  
3. Player can later type `load game [filename]`.  
4. System retrieves and restores the saved game state.  

**Alternative Courses:**

- Step 3: File not found → system creates a new file  

---

### Use Case 1.4: Undo Move

**Actors:** Player  
**Overview:** Player undoes the previous move.  

**Typical Course of Events:**

1. Player types `undo`.  
2. System reverts to the previous game state and displays the board.  

**Alternative Courses:**

- Step 2: No previous move available → system displays “No moves to undo.”  

---

### Use Case 1.5: Game Over

**Actors:** System, Player  
**Overview:** System detects end of game due to checkmate, stalemate, or resignation.  

**Typical Course of Events:**

1. System checks for game-ending conditions after each move.  
2. If checkmate detected → system declares winner.  
3. If stalemate or draw → system displays appropriate message.  
4. Player can start a new game or exit.  

**Alternative Courses:**

- Step 2: Player resigns manually using `resign` command → system declares opponent the winner.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** All commands must be intuitive and concise. The system should display usage help upon request.  
- **Performance:** Each move should be processed in under five seconds on standard hardware.  
- **Portability:** The bot must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux terminals.  
- **Reliability:** The game must maintain consistent state between moves and prevent illegal operations.  
- **Maintainability:** The codebase should be modular, allowing replacement of the AI engine or interface.
